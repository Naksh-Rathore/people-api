# people-api
This is my first backend API! It is a simple program written in Express JS and Node.js.
It has a simple array to store the people. You can use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods on them to change it (kind of like a database).
It does not save data after the program has closed, so it is not ready to be an actual website backend.
You can test it in Postman or any other tool.
Hope you like it!
Feel free to give recommendations, comments, and other!
